## :gift: Bonus: A Simple MySQL Function for Theater Rating Categorization
**This function converts a numeric rating into labels like "Excellent" or "Poor" based on rating. It helps make the ratings more understandable.**
# Function:
```sql
delimiter $$

create function get_rating_category(rating_value decimal(3,2))
returns varchar(20)
deterministic
begin
  declare category varchar(20);

  if rating_value >= 4.5 then
    set category = 'Excellent';
  elseif rating_value >= 3.5 then
    set category = 'Good';
  elseif rating_value >= 2.5 then
    set category = 'Average';
  elseif rating_value >= 1.5 then
    set category = 'Below Average';
  else
    set category = 'Poor';
  end if;

  return category;
end$$

delimiter ;

```

# How to use:
**Once the function is created, you can use it in a query.** 

# Example:
```sql
select 
  name, 
  rating, 
  get_rating_category(rating) as rating_category
from theaters_ksa;
```
